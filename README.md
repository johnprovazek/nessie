# nessiethegreat

## Description

The inspiration behind this project was to build a simple website for my friend’s band Nessie the Great. You can access this website at [nessiethegreat.com](https://www.nessiethegreat.com).

Built using vanilla JavaScript.

## Installation

This project wasn't intended to be duplicated. However, if you are an aspiring band and enjoy the layout feel free to clone this repo and use it as a template.

## Usage

This website was built with the intent to be hosted on GitHub Pages and pull the main content from [data.json](./data/data.json). This is to make it easy for someone non-technical to update the website.

## Credits

[lite-youtube](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) was used for faster YouTube player loading.

[font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/) was used for the icons.

[Let’s Create a Custom Audio Player](https://css-tricks.com/lets-create-a-custom-audio-player/) is a guide I followed to setup the custom audio players.

## Bugs & Improvements

- Recreate band logo to remove the css border hack.
- Improve page/image loading.
- Possibly switch to jinja templating.
- Investigate filling negative space with background decorations while avoiding text and images.
