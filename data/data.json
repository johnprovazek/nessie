    "bandbio": "The story begins in San Jose, California. Juan-Carlos Sandoval and Carson Lewis started playing music together in 2014 but were always deprived of a drummer. Eventually , they met drummer Nic Corona and started playing shows all over San Jose and the Bay Area. From 2016 up till 2019 the band was constantly playing shows wherever they could get booked. They became known for their reggae/rock sound and always had surprises in their live shows; you never knew when they would whip out a new and unexpected style. While blending genres, the bands backbone has always been reggae rock.  In 2020, just before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Nic Corona left the band. Early in the year 2021, Jettiny Ngo joined Nessie the Great as their new drummer. The band performed a few shows until an unfortunate turn of events required Juan Carlos to move to Texas for work. This however hasn't deterred the band and they are continuing to work on new music, sending tracks back and forth with each other, and releasing new songs. With their eyes set on success, they one day hope to hit the road and tour the world to spread that sweet reggae rock music to the globe. They have stated that their primary goals with this band is to \"make people groove\".",
