  "bandbio": "The story begins in San Jose, California. Juan-Carlos Sandoval and Carson Lewis started playing music together in 2014. Having multiple drummers over the years, they started playing shows all over San Jose and the Bay Area.The band was constantly playing shows wherever they could get booked. They became known for their reggae/rock sound and always had surprises in their live shows; you never knew when they would whip out a new and unexpected style. While blending genres, the bands backbone has always been reggae rock and blues. In 2022, the band relocated to Dallas, Texas. They can be found playing shows all DFW. Eventually they are looking to take this show on the road and spread that sweet sound. They have stated that their only goal as a band is to make people groove.",
